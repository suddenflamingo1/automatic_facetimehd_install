# automatic_facetimehd_install
This allows anyone to install the macbook camera without doing anything, except rebooting and echoing the facetime thingy

Note: you need a version of macOS installed on a seperate partition! If you don't have macOS installed, then use the option + command + r to boot into recovery mode
